### How to play

Choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid.
The pieces fall straight down, occupying the next available space within the column.
Try to create 4 in a row of your own color vertically, horizontally or diagonally. You can block your opponent from getting 4 in a row by putting your own disc in.
